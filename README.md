# Midi Generator

This project is really for me to try to wrap my head around midi and then to start learning some music theory

It's gonna be reinventing all the wheels but that feels fine its more for me to learn than to build somthing useful

# Goals

 - make a midi note play
 - make a midi chord play
 - play a random sequence of notes
 - play a random sequence of chords
 - trigger some drums
 - make a turing machine
 - understand the circle of 5ths
